# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It is a responsive web application that supports desktop, tablet, and mobile use.

Built upon a starter repo from Lighthouse Labs, this project serves as practice for front-end development skills including HTML, CSS, JS jQuery and AJAX, as well as back-end stacks such as Node, Express, and MongoDB.
